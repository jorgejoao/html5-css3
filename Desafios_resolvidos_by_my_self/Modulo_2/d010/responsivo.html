                In Chapters 1 and 2, we first explain basic concepts needed for building a website. For example, we describe text editors, web-hosting services, and browsers. We then narrow the focus and describe the basic components of a web page: HTML elements, tags, and attributes. We put those components into practice by examining a simple, but complete, web page. Chapter 1 concludes with a brief history of HTML.Chapter 2 continues the theme of introducing material that is somewhat general in nature. For example, we describe the W3C, coding conventions, and comments. After that, the chapter provides details on quite a few HTML elements: block elements, editing elements, phrasing elements, and so on. The chapter concludes with a discussion of character references.
