        <p>
            Since HTML’s introduction in 1993, web-programming technologies have been in flux, with web programmers using different versions of HTML for different browsers. The constant change made it difficult for authors to write quality textbooks about the subject. Consequently, most of the books were trade books, not textbooks. With HTML5’s approval as a “stable recommendation” in 2014, web programmers and browsers appear to have embraced it fully. With the huge demand for web programmers in the workforce, there has been a significant demand for web-programming courses for quite a while. Now that web programming has coalesced around HTML5, there is a need for better textbooks about web programming.
