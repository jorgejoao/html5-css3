            Some web-programming books try to present exhaustive content without trying to explain it fully. 
            That can lead to readers with poor understanding and weak retention of the content. In this book, 
            we carefully consider the proper amount of content to present in each chapter, so that there is ample opportunity for explanations and learning. We try to engage readers by using a fun, conversational tone.

            Although we take the time to carefully explain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax, we realize how important it is to develop the creativity and problem-solving skills necessary to become adept at web programming. With that in mind, we present the content in a manner that supports such development. Several of the leading web-programming textbooks embed much of their content within tutorials. Each tutorial provides step-by-step instructions that explain how to paste together code fragments to form a web page.

            That technique helps readers feel good about producing results, but when that’s all there is, not much actual learning takes place. Because there’s not much of a framework for organizing the content, that presentation strategy makes it difficult for readers to integrate new material into what they already know and to remember what they’ve learned. On the other hand, this book presents content with an optimal organization for learning. Within each chapter, we explain concepts, present problems, and solve those problems with short code fragments and also complete web pages.

            At the end of each chapter, we present optional case study sections that build upon each other to create an increasingly sophisticated website. In the case studies, we provide guidance and a discussion of design decisions, rather than step-by-step instructions. This forces readers to apply what they’ve learned earlier in the chapter, and it gives readers a feel for the real-world design process. Perhaps most importantly, the case studies provide practice for readers in fostering their creativity and problem-solving skills.
